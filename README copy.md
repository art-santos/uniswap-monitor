Hi, here's a message: 

I couldn't finish the test properly cause i've runned out of time. Despite it, i've used the graph to query the data, not web3. Initially, i tought about using web3.eth.getPastLogs to get previous transactions, then use web3.eth.getTransaction to pass it's hash and get the information about the amount in tokens that was changed. It would work, but the application wouldn't be so good as it is right now. Anyway, i'm also going to send you another version using the web3 library to fetch data. 

I've had some medical problems and runned a little out time. 

Thanks a lot for the test and attention!
